Mildly\ndistended loops of bowel in the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on\nthis radiograph.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PA & LAT)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-20\n\nReport: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:\n\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nCT abdomen and pelvis performed following administration of oral\nbut no IV contrast on a multidetector CT scanner.  Multiplanar reformations\nwere carried out.\n\nFINDINGS:\nThe liver is heterogeneous, compatible with cirrhosis.  The spleen is mildly\nenlarged measuring 13.7 cm.  The pancreas is normal in appearance on this\nnon-contrast examination.  The gallbladder fundus is thickened and\ndemonstrates an area of intramural calcification.  This likely represents an\narea of gallbladder adenomyomatosis though this could be further evaluated\nwith targeted ultrasound.  It is noted recent ultrasound did not directly\nvisualize this region of the gallbladder fundus.\n\nNo retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen in the abdomen.  No bowel\nobstruction is seen.  Though incompletely assessed on this unenhanced study, a\nnumber of anterior and right lateral abdominal wall venous collaterals are\nseen.  \n\nThere is large volume fluid in the peritoneal cavity.  The fluid predominantly\nmeasures low Hounsfield units, but there is an area of layering hyperdensity\nin the right paracolic gutter (series 2, image 52) and further layering\nhyperdensity in the fluid within the pelvis.  Findings are compatible with\nintraperitoneal hemorrhage superimposed on ascites.\n\nCT PELVIS:\nThere is abnormal thickening of the left rectus abdominis muscle deep aspect\nwhich measures up to 2.3 cm in anteroposterior dimension.  This extends over a\ndistance of 4.9 cm in craniocaudal length.\n\nPelvic ascites is seen in addition to layering hyperdensity within the pelvic\nfree fluid compatible with hematoperitoneum.\n\nLUNG BASES:\nThere is basal atelectasis bilaterally.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\nThere are multiple posterior right rib fractures, which do not appear acute\nand appear to be healing.  There are also multiple left rib fractures\ninvolving the left twelfth rib (series 2:25), the left eleventh rib (series\n301B, image 69), the left ninth rib (series 301B, image 66) and left seventh\nrib (series 301B, image 65).\n\nDegenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine of mild severity.\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-21\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung\nvolumes with mild bibasilar atelectatic change.  The opacification at the\nright base medially most likely represents merely crowding of normal pulmonary\nvessels.  Some artifacts limit the quality of the examination.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-23\n\nReport: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:\nThe cardiac size is top normal.  The mediastinal and\nhilar contours are unremarkable.  Linear atelectasis is noted in the left lung\nbase.  No focal consolidation is present to suggest pneumonia.  Mild linear\natelectasis is noted in the left lung base.  Blunting of the left costophrenic\nangle posteriorly is suggestive of a small pleural effusion. Fullness of the\nazygous vein raises question of early right heart failure.   Minimal\ninterstitial edema as suggested previously on ___ appears unchanged.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PA & LAT)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-24\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nThere is a moderate amount of free fluid within the abdomen.  A\nsite in the right lower quadrant was marked.  Reference is made to previous CT\ndated ___, and the location of the site of collateral vessels was\nnoted.  Color Doppler was applied at the site marked for paracentesis, and no\nvessels were visualized in this region.\nModality: Ultrasound\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-25\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nThere has been slight worsening of the left lower lobe opacity.\nRight basilar atelectasis is noted. There are low lung volumes bilaterally. \nNo pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette\nand hilar contours are normal.Left 5th rib fracture is noted.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PA & LAT)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-26\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall\nchange.  Continued low lung volumes with a patchy opacification at the left\nbase.  The findings are most consistent with atelectasis, though in view of\nthe clinical history, the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be\nunequivocally excluded.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PA & LAT)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-27\n\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nAbdominal ultrasound.\n\nFINDINGS:\nThere is moderate amount of ascites.  There is a heterogeneously\nappearing liver consistent with cirrhosis.  No focal liver lesions seen on\nlimited views of the liver.  There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The\ncommon bile duct measures between 8 - 10 mm.\n\nThe main portal vein is patent with anterograde and pulsatile flow.  The\nevaluation of pancreas is suboptimal with overlapping bowel gas.\n\nThe appearance of the gallbladder is very similar compared to prior study,\nwith a thickened wall, likely due to third spacing from ascites. There is\nfocal calcification and mild irregularity of the fundus of the gallbladder,\nwhich is similar to finding seen on CT likely due to adenomyomatosis.\nThe spleen is enlarged measuring 17 cm, on prior ultrasound measured 14 cm.\n\nFew images were obtained at the site of prior paracentesis; evaluation is\nsuboptimal; and no focal fluid collection seen in the skin.\nModality: Ultrasound\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-29\n\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nMDCT axial imaging is performed through the abdomen and pelvis\nafter administration of oral contrast only.  No IV contrast is administered.\nMultiplanar reformatted images were then obtained.\n\nCT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:\nThere are small bilateral pleural effusions\nwith adjacent atelectasis in the lung bases, slightly improved on the right\ncompared to ___.  There is no pericardial effusion.  Calcification along\nthe interatrial septum is again noted.\n\nThere is limited assessment of the viscera due to non-IV-contrast technique.\nNote is again made of cirrhotic morphology of the liver.  While the\nvasculature is incompletely assessed without IV contrast, multiple abdominal\ncollateral vessels, including umbilical vein, along with splenomegaly, are\ncompatible with portal hypertension.    Splenomegaly is again noted to be\nlarger than on ___, currently measuring up to 16.4 cm on sagittal\nreformatted images, previously 13.4 cm.  Large amount of ascites is\nredemonstrated, however, currently the fluid measures simple fluid in density.\n\nThe gallbladder is again distended, with wall thickening at the fundus,\nsimilar to that seen on prior CT and ultrasound, again suggesting\nadenomyomatosis.  Punctate calcification which was previously seen within a\nfold in the gallbladder fundus is now seen dependently in the body, consistent\nwith a tiny calculus.   \n\nThe non-enhanced pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, small bowel, and\ncolon appear unremarkable.  There is no free air in the abdomen.  No definite\nlymph node enlargement is seen meeting CT size criteria for adenopathy.\nAtherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the abdominal aorta, without\naneurysmal dilatation.\n\nCT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:\nLarge ascites in the pelvis currently measures\nsimple fluid in density.  The non-enhanced urinary bladder, uterus, ovaries,\nrectosigmoid colon, and pelvic loops of bowel appear unremarkable.  No free\nair nor definite adenopathy is noted.\n\nNote is made of anterior abdominal wall stranding at the level of the\numbilicus, unchanged.  Expanded appearance of the left rectus muscle,\ncompatible with intramuscular hematoma, is slightly decreased in size since\n___, currently 15 x 27 mm, previously 18 x 29 mm.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\nThere is diffuse disc bulge at the L3-4 and L4-5 levels.\nHealing fracture of the posterior right tenth and eleventh ribs are unchanged\nfrom ___.\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST\nNote ID: 10008924-RR-31\n\nReport: PORTABLE CHEST:\n\n\nFINDINGS:\nA shallow level of inspiration is observed.

        "radiology": "Report: CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF LIVER AND UPPER ABDOMEN:\n\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nMultidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung\nbases to the level of the renal hila after administration of intravenous\ncontrast.  Arterial and portal venous phase sequences were obtained.  The\nprocedure was performed immediately following percutaneous radiofrequency\nablation of the segment V/VI lesion.\n\nCT OF UPPER ABDOMEN:\nThere are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive\natelectasis.  No pneumothorax noted. \nThere is bilateral gynecomastia.  \nThe liver has a coarse irregular surface in keeping with known cirrhosis.  The\nspleen is enlarged measuring 14.5 cm in long axis.  There are periesophageal\nand splenic hilar varices. Note is made of a recanalized umbilical\nvein.Findings are in keeping with portal hypertension.\nIn the left lobe there is a 16 x 15 x 7 mm arterial enhancing segment II\nexophytic lesion. The lesion is closely related to the lesser curve of stomach\nand transverse colon.  Findings are stable since the recent MR of abdomen.\nSatisfactory appearance of the ablated lesion in segment VI of the right\nhepatic lobe.  There is  satisfactory ___ enhancement around the\nsegment V / VI lesion with a 2.3 x 4.6 x 3.4 cm low attenuation ablation zone.\nThe common duct is normal in caliber measuring 8 mm at the level of the\nampulla.  No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  There is a small volume of\nperihepatic free fluid, most notably around the dome of liver.  The portal\nveins are patent.     Post procedural changes along the percutaneous access\ntract are noted in the right flank.  \nNo other arterial enhancing lesions are identified.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURE:\nMild degenerative changes are seen involving the lower\nthoracic spine with anterior osteophyte formation:  No lytic or sclerotic bone\nlesions are identified in the imaged osseus structures.\n\nPROCEDURAL NOTE FOR RIGHT HEPATIC LOBE RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION:\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\nGeneral anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology service. \nPlease see relevant documentation.\n\nPHYSICIANS:\nDr. ___ and Dr. ___ performed the procedure. \nDr. ___ attending radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.\n\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:\nInformed consent was obtained in the outpatient\nclinic outlining the risks and benefits of the procedure involved.  Following\nthis, the patient was brought to the CT suite and placed supine on the imaging\ntable.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped and\ndraped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout were\nperformed as per ___ protocol.\n\nInitially, the right hepatic lobe was targeted.  Ultrasound demonstrated a\nhyperechoic mass lesion in the expected position.  Under real-time ultrasound\nguidance, a 17-gauge biopsy needle was advanced and positioned within the\nproximal portion of the lesion.  Two 18-gauge core biopsies were then taken. \nSamples were placed in formalin and sent for pathological assessment.  The\nbiopsy tract was then embolized with a Gelfoam slurry and good hemostasis was\nachieved.  Following biopsy, an 18 gauge RF ablation probe was positioned\nwithin the inferior segment of the right hepatic lobe lesion.  Following a\nsafety check confirming adequate positioning of the grounding pads an ablation\nwas performed of the lesion.  Gas formation was noted on real-time ultrasound.\nThe needle was then repositioned slightly more cranially to ensure a\nsatisfactory ablation zone and ablation again performed.\nFollowing this, the needle was removed.  A contrast-enhanced CT was performed\n(see report above).  Ultrasound was then used to try to target the left\nhepatic lobe lesion.  This lesion was not visible on ultrasound and given its\nproximity on the CT to adjacent colon and stomach, a decision was made not to\nproceed with RF ablation at this time.  \nSterile dressings were applied.  \nThe patient was transferred well to the post-anesthesia care unit.\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\nNote ID: 10056223-RR-18\n\nReport: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS:\nCompared to the prior exam, there is increase in\na large right pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse with slight\nleftward shift of the mediastinum. Retrocardiac atelectasis is present.  Heart\nsize is difficult to evaluate but at least moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal\nsilhouette, left hilar contour and pulmonary vasculature are normal.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PA & LAT)\nNote ID: 10056223-RR-21\n\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nMultidetector CT was used to acquire non-contrast, arterial,\nportal venous and delayed phase imaging of the liver and upper abdomen.  In\naddition, a non-contrast CT thorax was performed.  Coronal and sagittal\nreformats were evaluated.\n\nNON-CONTRAST CT OF THORAX:\nThere has been interval development of a large\nright-sided pleural effusion.  The ___ unit density of the fusion is\nbetween 40 and 50 indicative of hyperdense proteinaceous fluid, likely blood.\nThere is associated extensive right lower lobe collapse. No evidence of a\nlayering hematocrit level.  There is no pneumothorax.  Patchy air space\nopacity is noted in the apical segment of the left upper lobe, likely\ninflammatory in etiology.\n\nCT OF ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:\nThere has been a decrease in the amount of perihepatic and perisplenic fluid\nsince the RF procedure.  There is satisfactory appearance of the ablated\nlesion in segment VI of the liver.  There is no evidence of active arterial\nextravasation on the arterial phase images.  Note is made, however, of\nsegmental arterial portal venous shunting just medial to the ablated segment.\nThe ablation zone measures 2 x 3.8 x 2.9 cm.  A second hyperenhancing lesion\nis again identified arising exophytically from segment III of the liver.\nNo other arterial enhancing lesions are identified.\n\nChanges of cirrhosis and portal hypertension are again noted.  The liver has a\ncoarse and irregular outline. The spleen is enlarged measuring 14 cm in\ncraniocaudal dimension.  There are paraesophageal and splenic hilar varices.\nNote is also made of a left-sided splenorenal shunt.  \nNote is also made of a markedly enlarged and recanalized umbilical vein. There\nis no significant bowel wall thickening.  Both kidneys enhance symmetrically.\nNormal appearance of both adrenal glands.    Although incompletely imaged, the\nmost inferior slice demonstrates a patent vessel in the anterior abdominal\nwall likely secondary to paraumbilical varices (series 3BH, image 186).\nA large gallstone is again identified.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\nMild endplate degenerative changes are seen throughout\nthe lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae.  No evidence of a lytic or\nsclerotic lesion .\nModality: CT\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST\nNote ID: 10056223-RR-22\n\nReport: CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:\nLordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
