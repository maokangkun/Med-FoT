He had an episode of  syncope at home when walking down the stairs (SOB prior per  mother). When EMS arrived, pt was agitated but awake but became  unresponsive and was pulseless on arrival to the ___ ED.  For PEA arrest, he received CPR, atropine, and epi with ROSC. He  then became hypotensive w/asystole received Ca, bicarb, epi, and  CPR. Also had episode of VTACH s/p shock in OSH. OSH labs were  notable for eo's of 5.8 on diff, lactate 9.4, INR 1.75, Cr 8.2,  and FSBG of 58. He had a right femoral CVL placed, received 3L  of fluid, and was uptitrated to 3 pressors of levo/epi/neo. He  received no abx, 1 amp of glucose, and was transferred to ___  for further management.  He arrived to ___ on max does of norepi, epi and phenylephrine  gtts. He was unresponsive but s/p NMB (rocuronium at 11:30 AM)  en route via Medflight. His labs were notable for WBC 24.0 (12%  bands), H/H 11.9/36.0, PLT 31, INR 1.3, BUN/Cr 83/8.3, ALT 114,  AST 143, CK 5097, AP 337, TB 5.4, Lipase 61, CK MB 20, Uric acid  17.7, Phos 8.3, calcium 7.4, Cortisol 66.9, negative UA,  negative serum and urine tox screens. His initial blood gas was  7.00/___/72. Lactate was 4.0 and free Ca was 1.01. Blood and  urine cultures were sent. Imaging was notable for CXR with  pulmonary edema, CT head with no acute bleed but subtle  subcortical white matter hypodensity in the right frontal lobe,  CT c-spine without acute fracture, and CTA chest and abdomen  with no PE, type I choledochal cyst, 3.5 cm heterogeneous,  potentially enhancing left renal lesion concerning for neoplasm,  and ill-defined segment VII with hypodense liver lesion. A  bedside echo showed a hyperdynamic heart. He received 150  bicarb, vanc/zosyn, tamiflu, azithromycin, and was loaded with  amiodarone for persistent tachycardia and AF. He was  temperature-controlled for normothermia and reached 37oc by 3:40  ___. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.  On admission to the MICU, the patient's VS were: . He was noted  to be in AF with RVR. In speaking with the patient's mother, the  patient only takes medications given to him by her. His only  regular medications are atenolol and protonix. He takes  indomethacin and colchicine as needed, and last dose was 5 days  ago. Because of not feeling well over the past few days, his  mother reported that the patient took 2 capsules of keflex  yesterday, but was not taking a prescribed antibiotic course.

The\naorta demonstrates normal caliber without evidence of intramural hematoma or\ndissection. The partially-imaged aortic arch branches are normal.  The main,\nright, and left pulmonary arteries are well-opacified. There is no evidence of\nlobar or segmental intraluminal filling defect.  The distal segmental and\nsubsegmental pulmonary arterial branches are not well visualized. There is no\narteriovenous malformation.\n\nCHEST:\nA heterogeneous, predominantly hypodense lesion within the left thyroid lobe\nis only partially imaged. The heart and pericardium are within normal limits. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal, supraclavicular,\nor axillary lymphadenopathy.  An ET tube is seen within the trachea, with\ndistal tip terminating 5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen within\nthe esophagus, which is otherwise normal.\n\nLung windows demonstrate interlobular septal thickening and mild ground-glass\nopacities most conspicuous in the lung apices, consistent with mild pulmonary\nedema.  There is bibasilar atelectasis. Otherwise, the imaged lungs are clear.\n\nABDOMEN:\nAn ill-defined hypodensity in segment VII of the liver is not\nwell-characterized.  Attention of follow-up imaging.  Otherwise, the liver\nenhances homogeneously without concerning focal lesion. There is no\nintrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The portal vein is patent.  There is\nfusiform dilation of the extrahepatic common hepatic and common bile duct and\nthe cystic duct measuring up to 53 mm, compatible with a Type I choledochal\ncyst. Anti-dependent hyperdense material within the gallbladder lumen may\nrepresent sludge, however, underlying mass lesion is also of concern given\ncholedochal cyst.\n\nThe pancreas enhances homogeneously without peripancreatic stranding or ductal\ndilation. There is no splenomegaly or focal splenic lesion. The adrenal glands\nare normal bilaterally.\n\nA 3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially enhancing lesion arises from the left\nrenal cortex, and demonstrates a mildly thickened hyperdense, likely enhancing\nperipheral wall, concerning for neoplasm.  The ipsilateral renal vein is\npatent.  Smaller hypodensities within the left renal cortex are too small to\ncharacterize. Otherwise, the kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically without\nevidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nAn enteric tube terminates in the stomach fundus, which is normal appearing.\nSmall bowel loops are relatively decompressed, without evidence of wall\nthickening or obstruction.

The biliary drains travel through a CBD  metallic stent. There is\nminimal residual intrahepatic biliary dilatation, notably in segments 3  5 and\n8.  \n\nThere are no discrete lesions within the liver to suggest liver metastasis or\nbile lakes.  There is irregularity surrounding the gallbladder fundus, which\nis likely reactive edema. \n\nEvaluation of the pancreas demonstrates no evidence of abnormal masses.  There\nis no gross lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis or in the peripancreatic\nregion.  \n\nVascular structures are patent, including splenic vein, portal confluence, and\nintrahepatic portal vein branches.  Spleen, bilateral kidneys and adrenal\nglands are unremarkable in appearance.  There is overall anasarca and\nmesenteric edema.\n\nPELVIS:\nThere is moderate amount of  fluid within the pelvis with thin layer\nof dependent hematocrit level.  There is no frank adenopathy.  There is\nscattered diverticulosis without diverticulitis.\n\nVASCULAR STRUCTURES:\nThere are scattered atherosclerotic calcifications of\nthe abdominal aortic vessels, without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\nThere is no evidence of destructive lytic lesions or\nacute fractures.\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST\nNote ID: 10060764-RR-13\n\nReport: TYPE OF THE EXAM:\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nMultiple axial MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained\npost-administration of intravenous contrast and ingestion of oral contrast.\n\nLUNG BASES:\nThere are bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size\nwith associated atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.\n\nABDOMEN:\nThere are two percutaneously placed biliary anchor drains.  The\nright catheter appears to have a straighter course compared to the prior CT,\npost-revision.  The distal tip of the right catheter is seen extending to the\nproximal end of the the metallic common bile duct stent which itself extends\ninto the right common hepatic duct.  The left-sided catheter is seen with\ndistal tip just proximal to the left-sided metal stent.  There is intermediate\nattenuation material within the drains and stents.  This is often noted and\nevaluation for luminal obstruction is limited.\n\nThere is mild nonspecific enhancement of the hepatic parenchyma surrounding\nthe right sided drain, possibly representing post procedural changes. Compared\nto the prior study, there is development of a small to moderate amount of\nperihepatic, subhepatic ascites and perisplenic ascites.  The gallbladder is\nnot abnormally distended. There is surrounding fluid.  There is small amount\nof fluid in the left paracolic gutter which is slightly increased compared to\nthe prior study.  There is no significant lymphadenopathy within the abdomen\nor pelvis.  The pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are stable.  Kidneys\nenhance homogeneously without abnormalities.\n\nPELVIS:\nThere is a stable amount of fluid within the pelvis.  There are\nnumerous colonic diverticula.  No evidence of enlarged lymphadenopathy within\nthe pelvis.  There is minimal stranding along the right-sided colon which\nprobably is in the setting of anasarca.\n\nOsseous structures are stable without evidence of worrisome blastic or lytic\nlesions or acute fractures.\n\nVASCULAR STRUCTURES:\nAtherosclerotic plaques of the aorta and iliac vessels\nare noted.

No\nconsolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected\non this single view.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.  Patulous\nesophagus is again noted.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nNote ID: 10080928-RR-65\n\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nMDCT images were obtained through the chest, abdomen and pelvis\nfollowing the administration of IV contrast.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n\nCHEST:\nThere is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The\naorta is normal in caliber.  There are no filling defects in the pulmonary\nartery to the subsegmental level.  The airways are patent to the subsegmental\nlevel.  The esophagus appears normal.  There is no pleural effusion or\npneumothorax.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  There are coronary\nartery calcifications.  There is streaky atelectasis at the lung bases.  No\nfocal consolidation is seen.  There is a 5 mm nodule seen in the right middle\nlobe, similar to study on ___.  A subpleural nodule is seen\nmeasuring 4 mm (2, 50), similar to ___.\n\nABDOMEN:\nA calcified granuloma is seen in the liver, similar to prior study. \nThere is perfusion anomaly in the posterior right lobe.  There is significant\nintrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, mainly involving the left lobe.  There\nis significant dilation of the common bile duct measuring up to 1.5 cm in\ndiameter.  The gallbladder is significantly distended with cholelithiasis. \nThere is no evidence of bowel wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.  The\npancreas is unremarkable.  The spleen is normal.  There is a 1.3 cm cyst in\nthe upper pole of the left kidney.  Otherwise, the kidneys are unremarkable. \nThere is no hydronephrosis.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal\nlymphadenopathy.  The pancreatic duct is dilated.\n\nThe stomach appears normal.  There are dilated loops of small and large bowel,\nindicating possible ileus.  There is no evidence of obstruction.\n\nPELVIS:\nThe bladder and terminal ureters are unremarkable.  Prostate and\nseminal vesicles are normal.  The rectum is unremarkable.  There is no free\nfluid in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nCTA:\nThe intra-abdominal vasculature is patent.  There are scattered aortic\ncalcifications.  There are no aneurysms identified.  No evidence of\ndissection.\n\nThe celiac artery and its major branches are patent.  SMA and its major\nbranches are patent.  Some calcifications of the splenic artery.  The ___ is\npatent.\nModality: CT\nRegion: Chest\nExam Name: CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY\nNote ID: 10080928-RR-66\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nAgain seen is total knee replacement and the hardware appears in\nappropriate position without evidence of complication.  There is no fracture\nidentified.  There is a moderate-sized joint effusion, decreased from the\nprior study. Skin staples are again seen anteriorly.\nModality: Radiograph\nRegion: Knee\nExam Name: KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT\nNote ID: 10080928-RR-67\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nThe liver is of normal echogenicity, and there are no focal liver\nlesions.  The gallbladder is very distended and filled with likely sludge and\nstones.  There is no definite pericholecystic fluid or wall thickening.  The\ncommon bile duct is very dilated and measures 1.1 cm in diameter.\nModality: Ultrasound\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)\nNote ID: 10080928-RR-68\n\nReport: FINDINGS:\nThere is mild right basilar atelectasis.  Right internal jugular\ncentral venous catheter ends at or just below the cavoatrial junction.  There\nis no focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. \nThere is a slight increase in density in the right paratracheal area which may\nrepresent mild bleeding from line placement.
