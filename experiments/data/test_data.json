Axial images\nwere interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.\n\nDLP:\n404 mGy-cm\nCTDIvol:  8 mGy\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n\nCHEST:\nThe visualized lung bases are clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial\neffusion.\n\nABDOMEN:\nThe liver and gallbladder are normal.  The portal and hepatic veins are\npatent. The pancreas and spleen are unremarkable.  The adrenal glands are\nnormal bilaterally.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically with no hydronephrosis.\n\nThe stomach and small bowel are normal in caliber. Within the right lower\nquadrant, there is a dilated, hyperdense structure rising from the base of the\ncecum, which measures up to 9 mm, likely representing the appendix\ndemonstrating mucosal hyperenhancment with respect to adjacent bowel.  What is\nmost striking is hyperenhancement and wall thickening rather than fluid\ncontent.  Inflammatory changes are noted at the base of the cecum, and\nadjacent to the whole wall of the appendix, and probably particularly at the\ntip, which has an indistinct appearance.\n\nWithin the mesentery adjacent to the ascending colon, there are two strikingly\nenlarged and briskly enhancing lymph nodes measuring 1.4 and 1.8 cm, the\nformer with low-density material centrally, and both demonstrate surrounding\ninflammatory changes, including marked fat stranding about the node with\nsuspected necrotic or suppurative changes.\n\nThe ascending, transverse, and descending colon are unremarkable. There is no\nmesenteric free air.\n\nPELVIS:\nThe urinary bladder, and adnexa are unremarkable. The uterus contains\nan intrauterine device, and standard position. Small amount of simple free\nfluid is seen in the pelvis, likely physiologic.\n\nVESSELS:\nThe aorta is normal in caliber and its major branches are patent.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\nNo focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for\nmalignancy.\n\nNOTIFICATION:\nFindings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___\ntelephone at 23:52 on ___.\n\n"

Small amount of free intraperitoneal air\nvisualized on the CT performed hours later are not visualized.  The visualized\nportion of the lung bases are clear. The osseous structures of the abdomen\nappear normal.\n\nNote ID: 12145137-RR-65\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nAxial MDCT images were obtained from lung bases to symphysis pubis\nwith oral contrast administration.  No IV contrast was used.  Sagittal and\ncoronal reformatted images were then obtained.  The IV contrast was not given\nto the patient due to patient's high creatinine.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:\nThe visualized portion of the lung\nbases does not demonstrate any pulmonary nodule, parenchymal opacification or\npleural effusion.  The aortic annulus shows some calcification.  Calcification\nof the coronary arteries are also visualized with tiny gas bubbles are\nvisualized inside the right atrium, most likely related to the patient IV\naccess..  Large axial hiatal hernia with evidence of reflux is visualized.\n\nThe liver is unchanged in appearance.  There is mild intra- and extra-hepatic\nbiliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder is prominent, but there is no\nevidence of cholecystitis.\n\nThe adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, stomach, duodenum and loops of small\nbowel appear normal. The liver is fatty. Both kidneys are shrunken with no\nevidence of hydronephrosis, mass, or stones.  The large bowel loops that are\ninside the abdominal cavity also appear normal.  No free fluid is noted within\nthe abdomen, but there are diffuse locules of air in the intraperitoneal\ncavity which also extends along the porta hepatis.  The urinary bladder and\ndistal ureters appear normal.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:\nThe rectum appears normal.  There is\ndiffuse thickening of the sigmoid colon with ____ which appears to\nbe perforated with surrounding extraluminal air.  There is also thickening of\nthe surrounding sigmoid colon mesentery which also contains some gas locules.\n\nThe patient is status post thrombectomy of the axillobifemoral and the left\nsuperficial femoral artery bypass.\n\nBONE WINDOWS:\nNo concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are visualized.  Mild\nectasia of the suprailiac aorta is noted, measuring up to 21 mm.  The aorta\nshows severe calcification.\n\nNote ID: 12145137-RR-66\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nAxial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic\nsymphysis with intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images\nare provided.\n\nCONTRAST:\nOral and intravenous non-ionic contrast were administered.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:\nA 3 mm probably calcified nodule\nin the lingula is unchanged.  Note is made of a prominently opacifying pair of\ncollateral veins traversing the pericardium and coursing to the\nretroperitoneum.  The heart and pericardium appear otherwise unremarkable. A\nsmall left pleural effusion is present with adjacent passive atelectasis. The\nliver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear within normal\nlimits. There is no hydronephrosis. The kidneys appear somewhat atrophic\nbilaterally. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber proximally, with\nprominent mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease, and\noccludes proximal to the aortic bifurcation. An extra-anatomic bypass graft is\nvisualized in the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank.\n\nThe small bowel is dilated with air fluid levels and a transition point in the\nupper pelvis.  Contrast passes to decompressed distal loops, however,\nconsistent with a partial small-bowel obstruction. Contrast in the colon\nprobably relates to the previous scan of ___ due to its increased\ndensity.\n\nThere is continued colonic mural thickening involving the sigmoid and distal\ndescending colon, at the site of previously seen ____. A collection\nmeasuring 2.3 x 4.3 cm containing gas and hyperdensity possibly suggestive of\nextravasated oral contrast is now present (2:54, 57) just adjacent to the site\nwhere extraluminal gas indicated perforation on the prior study.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:\nThe bladder contains air,\nsuggestive of possible Foley catheter insertion although clinical correlation\nis necessary.  There is increased edema of the sigmoid colon in comparison\nwith ___.  A small fluid collection measuring 2.4 x 4.1 cm with\nperipheral enhancement is seen just adjacent to the rectum (2:70), new since\nthe previous examination.  Extra-anatomic bypass grafts (axillary- femoral and\ncross-femoral), opacify symmetrically.  There are no pathologically enlarged\npelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.\n\nBONE WINDOWS:\nBone windows show old healed fractures of left-sided ribs and\ndegenerative change of the thoracic and lumbar spine with no lesions worrisome\nfor osseous metastatic disease.\n\nNote ID: 12145137-RR-69\nModality: Drainage\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXCLUDING APPENDICEAL\nReport: PROCEDURE:\nThe risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the\npatient, and written informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout\nwas performed using two patient identifiers.  The patient was placed supine on\nthe CT table.  Initial scanning again showed a collection in the left lower\nquadrant, adjacent to the colon, containing air and oral contrast and\nmeasuring 5.7 x 4.8 cm.  The skin of the left lower quadrant was prepped and\ndraped in standard sterile fashion.  After local anesthesia with 6 cc of 1%\nlidocaine, and direct CT guidance, a 19-gauge ___ needle was advanced into\nthe collection in the left lower quadrant and a 0.038 ___ wire advanced\ninto the cavity after visualization of a small amount of pus draining from the\nneedle.  An 8 ___ dilator was then passed over the wire and an 8 ___\npigtail catheter advanced into the collection.  The pigtail was formed and\nlocked and 20 cc of purulent sanguinous material aspirated and sent to\nmicrobiology.  The catheter was placed to external bag for continued\ndraininage and was secured to the skin with a StatLock device. The patient\ntolerated the procedure well, with no complications evident at the time of the\nprocedure. The attending radiologist, Dr. ___, was present and supervising\nthroughout the procedure.\n\nMODERATE SEDATION:\nThe patient received 100 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of\nVersed in divided doses for moderate sedation during a total intraservice time\nof 25 minutes, during which time, the patient's hemodynamic parameters were\ncontinuously monitored.\n\nNote ID: 12145137-RR-71\nModality: CT\nRegion: Abdomen\nExam Name: CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\nReport: TECHNIQUE:\nMDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis after oral and Optiray\nIV contrast with multiplanar reformats.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:\nA 3-mm calcified nodule of the lingula is\nunchanged, probably granuloma.  Redemonstrated is the prominent opacifying\npair of collateral veins traversing the pericardium and coursing into the\nretroperitoneum.  The lung bases are clear.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,\npancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The gallbladder is somewhat\ndistended probably from n.p.o. status.  Somewhat atrophic appearance of the\nkidneys is stable.  Occlusion of the abdominal aorta is redemonstrated.  The\nextra anatomic bypass graft in the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank\nopacifies well.  Small bowel is not dilated.  Oral contrast passes freely\nthrough to the rectum.  Again demonstrated is colonic wall thickening of the\nsigmoid and distal descending colon.  The extraluminal collection of the left\npericolic gutter adjacent to the iliacus muscle remains.  Compared to\n___, there has been interval placement of a percutaneous pigtail drainage\ncatheter.  The collection contains fluid, bubbles of gas and a small amount of\nhyperdensity possibly extravasated oral contrast.  Despite the presence of the\ndrainage catheter, the collection has increased in size, now measuring on\naxial view 4.6 x 3.3 cm, previously 4.3 x 2.3 cm.  Local inflammatory\nstranding has worsened.  There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:\nSigmoid colonic wall thickening is not\nappreciably different from ___.  Redemonstrated are numerous sigmoid\ndiverticula.  The rectum, prostate, seminal vesicles, and bladder are\nunremarkable.  There is a small low-density fluid collection anterior to the\nrectum persists and is now slightly smaller in size on axial view 3.4 x 1.5\ncm, previously 3.8 x 1.9 cm.  The extra anatomic bypass graft (axillary-\nfemoral and cross femoral) opacify well.\n\nBONE WINDOWS:\nOld-healed fracture of left-sided ribs are noted.  There are\ndegenerative changes of the spine.\n\n"
